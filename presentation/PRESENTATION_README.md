## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This

1. **Read slides word-for-word** - boring!
2. **Apologize or be negative** - "sorry this isn't..."
3. **Go over time** - respect the limit
4. **Focus only on tech** - tell the story
5. **Skip the challenges** - honesty builds trust
6. **Rush through** - pace yourself
7. **Hide behind slides** - engage with audience

### ✅ Do This Instead

1. **Use slides as prompts** - tell the story
2. **Be confident** - you did great work
3. **End exactly on time** - shows preparation
4. **Balance tech with story** - journey narrative
5. **Be honest about struggles** - relatable
6. **Take your time** - clear, measured delivery
7. **Connect with people** - eye contact, smile

## ❓ Handling Q&A

### Expected Questions

**Q: "Would you use this in production?"**
✅ "The architecture is production-ready - follows industry patterns like dvaas. Would need to add authentication, more robust error handling, and comprehensive testing. But the foundation is solid."

**Q: "Did AI make mistakes?"**
✅ "Absolutely. AI created 7 bugs and fixed 12 total. The key is having the technical knowledge to spot issues quickly and guide corrections. You still need expertise."

**Q: "What's the biggest limitation?"**
✅ "Context management. AI can lose track of the bigger picture, especially in complex changes. You need strong architectural vision to keep everything coherent."

**Q: "How much did you actually code yourself?"**
✅ "About 15% manual coding - integration fixes, configuration tweaking, validation. But 100% of the architecture decisions and problem-solving were mine. I'm the conductor, AI is the orchestra."

**Q: "Which AI model was best?"**
✅ "Each has strengths. GPT-4 for architecture, Claude for detailed explanations, Gemini for rapid iteration. Using multiple models gave me the best results."

**Q: "Would this work for legacy code?"**
✅ "For greenfield projects and prototypes, absolutely - that's where AI shines. For complex legacy systems, AI is better for specific features than full rewrites. You still need deep understanding of the existing system."

**Q: "What surprised you most?"**
✅ "Two things: First, how FAST you can build with AI - 3-4x is real. Second, the emotional shift - feeling less like a coder and more like an architect/conductor. It's a different skill set."
