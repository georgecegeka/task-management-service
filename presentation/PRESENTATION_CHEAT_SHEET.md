## 🚨 IF RUNNING OVER TIME

**2:45 - SKIP TO CLOSING**
"Let me jump to the key insight: AI didn't replace me, it made me 3x more productive..."

**2:30 - CUT CHALLENGES SHORT**
"While I faced non-deterministic results and context loss, the bottom line is..."

**2:00 - EMERGENCY CONDENSE**
"Built full-stack in 6 hours, 3-4x faster, 85% AI-generated, still needed my expertise. The paradigm is shifting from HOW to WHAT. AI amplifies developers. Questions?"

---

## 🚨 IF RUNNING UNDER TIME

**1:30 - ADD EMOTIONAL JOURNEY**
Expand on "Am I even coding?" feeling

**2:00 - ADD TECHNICAL DETAIL**
Mention SSE transport, JSON-RPC 2.0

**2:30 - ADD DEMO**
Show running application

## 💡 TRANSITION PHRASES

**Moving to next topic:**
- "So here's what happened..."
- "But here's the thing..."
- "Let's talk about reality..."
- "The real insight here is..."

**Emphasizing a point:**
- "And this is key..."
- "Here's what's important..."
- "This is the game-changer..."

**Being honest:**
- "Let's be real..."
- "I won't sugarcoat it..."
- "Here's the truth..."

## ❓ QUESTION PREP

**Q: Production-ready?**
A: "Architecture yes, but needs auth, better error handling, testing"

**Q: AI mistakes?**
A: "Yes - 7 bugs created, 12 fixed. Need knowledge to spot issues"

**Q: Biggest limitation?**
A: "Context management. AI loses big picture. You guide the vision"

**Q: Your role?**
A: "15% coding, 100% architecture & validation. Conductor, not player"

**Q: Would you do it again?**
A: "Absolutely. 3-4x faster is game-changing for prototypes"
